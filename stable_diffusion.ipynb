        "prompt = \"A whimsical, surreal scene of a cow with large, majestic wings soaring gracefully through the sky. The cow has soft, brown and white patches on its fur, with two massive, feathered wings extending from its sides, resembling angelic or mythical wings. Its eyes are calm and peaceful, and it's flying high above a lush green meadow dotted with colorful wildflowers, with mountains in the distance. The wings are detailed with fine feathers that shimmer under the sunlight, creating a magical, dreamlike atmosphere. The cow’s body is perfectly balanced in the air, with its hooves tucked beneath it as it glides effortlessly. The sky is a vibrant blue, with a few soft clouds scattered across the horizon. The lighting is warm and soft, casting a gentle glow on the cow’s body and wings. The entire scene exudes a sense of lightness and freedom, with the cow flying peacefully, as if it's part of a fantastical world.\"\n",
